<h1> Irina Berger </h1>
<h2> Web Developer </h2>
<p> I have been doing software testing, writing test plans and developing automated tests for 15 years. </p>  
<p> I hold a Master of Science Degree in Mechanical Engineering and I am finishing training by Intellectics Arnion Center to enter into the field of Web development. </p> 
<p> In order to build my portfolio, I am offering free help web development for a limited time. </p> 
<p> Perhaps you’re a small business that needs a site refresh. Or a non-profit organization wanting a completely new site. Or a web development company willing to give an entry level developer a chance. </p> 

<p> The segue to Development was an organic one – a natural next step where I welcome the challenges and creative opportunity </p>  
<p> My testing background required me to always put myself in the shoes of the customer or end user.  To consider what they need and want. </p> 
<p> Looking through that lens helps make sure the site is not just attractive and compelling but is easy and fast for people to navigate. </p>  

<h3> A word about who I am </h3>
<p> I’m a team player for sure; love collaboration; get excited about other people’s ideas; and do everything in my power to do a great job, no matter how small or big the project. </p>
